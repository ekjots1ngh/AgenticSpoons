# 🎥 AgentSpoons Demo Video Script

## Scene 1: Hook (0:00-0:15)
**Visual**: Animated logo, charts
**Narration**: "What if you could predict market volatility with the accuracy of Wall Street quantitative traders? Meet AgentSpoons - the first autonomous volatility oracle on Neo blockchain."

## Scene 2: Problem (0:15-0:35)
**Visual**: Screenshots of expensive Bloomberg terminal, centralized oracle issues
**Narration**: "DeFi options protocols need reliable volatility data. Current solutions cost $24,000 per year and rely on centralized oracles. This creates single points of failure and limits DeFi growth."

## Scene 3: Solution Overview (0:35-1:00)
**Visual**: Architecture diagram with 5 agents
**Narration**: "AgentSpoons solves this with 5 autonomous AI agents that calculate real-time volatility using sophisticated quantitative models - the same math used by hedge funds - and publishes directly to Neo blockchain every 5 minutes."

## Scene 4: Live Demo - Dashboard (1:00-1:45)
**Visual**: Screen recording of championship dashboard
**Narration**: "Here's the system running live. Watch these metrics update in real-time:
- NEO price at $15.23
- Realized volatility: 52% (calculated from historical prices)
- Implied volatility: 58% (what the market thinks)
- Spread: 6% - that's a tradeable arbitrage opportunity

See the green line? That's actual volatility. The red line is market expectations. When they diverge, traders can profit."

## Scene 5: Technical Deep Dive (1:45-2:15)
**Visual**: Code snippets, GARCH formula, 3D surface
**Narration**: "Under the hood, we've implemented:
- GARCH(1,1) forecasting - predicts next day's volatility
- Seven different volatility estimators including Garman-Klass
- Black-Scholes engine with full Greeks
- Machine learning with XGBoost for pattern recognition
- 3D volatility surfaces showing the complete smile

All in production-quality code that would pass code review at Jane Street."

## Scene 6: Neo Integration (2:15-2:35)
**Visual**: Neo logo, smart contract code, blockchain explorer
**Narration**: "Our Neo N3 smart contract stores this data permanently on-chain. Any DApp can query it:
- Options protocols price contracts
- Lending protocols adjust collateral ratios
- New volatility derivatives can be built

One function call gives you institutional-grade volatility data."

## Scene 7: Business Model (2:35-2:50)
**Visual**: Revenue projections, use case icons
**Narration**: "The business model is simple: charge 0.30 dollars per query. With just 100 DApps making 10 queries per day, that's $109,000 annual revenue. And we've built the infrastructure that makes a $10 million options market possible on Neo."

## Scene 8: Credentials (2:50-3:05)
**Visual**: Your photo, university logo, company logos
**Narration**: "I'm Ekjot, a second-year Mathematics student at City University London, preparing for quantitative trading roles at firms like Jane Street and Hudson River Trading. I built AgentSpoons to prove I can create production-grade quantitative systems."

## Scene 9: Call to Action (3:05-3:20)
**Visual**: GitHub repo, live demo link, contact info
**Narration**: "AgentSpoons is open source on GitHub. Try the live demo at localhost:8050. For Neo hackathon judges: this solves a real problem, demonstrates deep technical skill, and creates actual value for the Neo ecosystem. Let's make DeFi options markets a reality."
